### Post View Count WordPress Plugin. 

## Features
- Using a post meta, the plugin stores the view count for a post. This count is incremented each time the post is viewed.
- In the admin post list screen, a custom admin column is added that shows the view count for each post. This admin column is sortable, allowing the user to sort posts by view count.
- A shortcode is registered that accepts a post ID. It queries the post meta and returns the view count for that post. 

## Installation
1. Download the plugin and upload it to your WordPress plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the plugin settings as per your needs.

## Usage
Once activated, the plugin automatically suggests related posts based on the category of the current post.

## Shortcode
- [wtdpvc_post_view_count id=76]: With the post ID specified, you can display the post count on the frontend.
- [wtdpvc_post_view_count]: You can use this shortcode directly within your single post page to display the post count without specifying a post ID.
